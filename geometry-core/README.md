Vectorial algebra.

This project depends on pebble-extensions and astyle-java-wrapper.

This project builds classes for vectorial algebra: tuples, vectors, points and matrix.

It uses _automatic code generation_ to reduce the amount of code that is needed to build this type of libraries.

Pebble text template with some custom classes is extensively used to build code.
